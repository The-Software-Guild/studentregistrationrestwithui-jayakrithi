<!-- Ajax (which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) is a combination of technologies 
Clients (usually JavaScript code running in a web browser) use Ajax to exchange data with web services. 
This approach is used extensively in modern web applications to help give them the feel of a desktop application. 
This smoother desktop feel is possible because the HTML page does not reload when making an Ajax call. 
The Ajax call is made, data is returned from the web service, and then JavaScript code dynamically updates only 
the portions of the page that need to be updated. -->
<!-- XHR is an application programming interface, or API, that allows JavaScript code to exchange data with 
web services by exchanging requests and responses over HTTP or HTTPS. Although we could make these calls 
directly in our JavaScript code, there are several libraries available, including jQuery, that wrap XHR 
with code that makes it more convenient to make Ajax calls. -->
<!-- CORS
By default, all browsers enforce the same origin policy. This policy enforces the rule that JavaScript code 
running in the browser is only allowed to make calls back to the domain of its page. For example, 
JavaScript code running in a page from >www.example.com can only make calls back to www.example.com. 
The browser would prevent calls back to www.anotherdomain.com or any other domain for that matter.
There are some situations where we don't want the browser to follow this policy. One example is if your HTML 
pages are served up from www.example.com but your client code makes calls back to web services on another 
subdomain like services.example.com
we can use Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). CORS allows some resource sharing across domains â€“ 
it is not a free for all but allows the HEAD, GET, and POST HTTP methods -->

<!--
The integrity and crossorigin attributes are used for Subresource Integrity (SRI) checking. 
This allows browsers to ensure that resources hosted on third-party servers have not been 
tampered with. Use of SRI is recommended as a best-practice, whenever libraries are loaded 
from a third-party source.
